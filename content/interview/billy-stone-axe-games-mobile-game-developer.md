First of all, isn't it amazing to think that +45 million people worldwide, play the games that you've been ideating, crafting, implementing, and producing? Big WOW! that too an indie game studio managed by a solo developer.

*Glossary*

Indie game studio: 1-30 employees who work in the game studio.

Casual game: A mobile game that has a shorter playing duration with easier logic and rules that anyone can play.

Hyper casual game: A mobile game that is very easy to play with straightforward logics and 2D graphics, requires no instruction to start playing. 

## A bit about the background

[Billy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/munkhbileg-natsagdorj-1aa735150/) started his career as a mobile game developer in 2018, employed by a gaming company located in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia where he worked for around 4 months. After grasping the knowledge of producing casual and hyper-casual games, he quit the company and started his own game studio.

Since then, he successfully published hit games every year including "Traffic Turn" (2019), "Archer Warrior"(2020), "Catch and Shoot" (2021), and "Slap and Run" in 2022. The games reached **#1 Top chart over 25 countries** with total **+45 million** downloads worldwide. (wow! those are pretty big numbers)

Billy's career path till now is pretty interesting, quite different from general Computer Science background engineers. I believe he has enough relevant knowledge to share with all of us to learn from.

## Career path: Mobile game developer

### How to become a mobile game developer?

I've asked what type of basic skills are required to become a mobile game developer, can anyone become it or does it require more creative skills? He answered with below collective traits in the given order.

**Skills that 'must-have'**

- Imaginative 
- Innovative (Creative)
- Logical (view things from different angles, come up with corner cases)
- Basic coding skills
- Dedicated, hardworking 
- Communication skill 

**Skills that are 'nice-to-have'**

- Googling: searching the things efficiently on the internet
- Basic game design
- Animation creation
- Perfectionist mindset (great plus point)
   
Great! now we got to know how to become a game dev. Let's assume we've developed some good games that are engaging and fun to play. So what happens next? 

Should we just develop and keep publishing numerous mobile games by ourselves on AppStore or PlayStore till the downloads hit the top chart? How to market it efficiently? Basically what to do next, where and whom should we contact to move further?

He suggested that before really going to the "industry" (means, wait till publishing the game on stores), do the following.

**Before entering the market**

- Do research the similar type of games
- Benchmark
- Up to date with market trends and analytics

### How to enter the market?

The development of the very first game is a great achievement to applaud for. So before publishing, he suggested below

- Consult with fellow game developers, and ask their opinion about engagement and overall game idea
- Professional consulting with experienced devs
- Record the video of the gameplay and keep "build" files ready
- Contact and reach out to game companies or publishers instead of doing everything on own

I've asked what type of companies should be reached out to at first, since there are many big companies, that don't really collaborate with indie game studios. He recommends the below companies to consider, all of them welcome newly established game studios.

**Junior-friendly companies to contact**
- Voodoo (https://www.voodoo.io/)
   
   Voodoo Academy also supports new/junior game studios - https://www.voodoo.io/academy

- Supersonic Studios (https://supersonic.com/)
- CrazyLabs (https://www.crazylabs.com/)

Yeey! hopefully, our readers can publish some hit games sooner.

## Opportunities

The most exciting part is **the Opportunities**. I was eagerly waiting to write this part actually! 

I've asked Billy about the opportunities if we choose to become game dev. Because sometimes we tend to follow the traditional, safer paths for our career base. I believe this section might help many of us to shift our mindset, open our eyes, and embrace the challenge. 

**The best things**

- Digital nomad lifestyle: can work from anywhere in the world 
- Beyond Border: International game developers welcoming connection and network
- Financial rewards (passive income)
- Can build an international game studio 
- More fun coding

**Drawbacks**

- Burnout risk: Highly stressful (saturated market requires new ideas every day)
- Many NOs before getting YES from publishers (due to high competencies)
- Longer hours investing for own skills (all-day coding)
- Financial success is not guaranteed, a bit risky to jump into the industry
- Creative industry (a bit challenging compared to other tech industries)
