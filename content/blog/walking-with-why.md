I think it takes courage to walk with why. It is easier to say if someone’s life is not aligned with their own values, but can we at least think again why it is difficult to walk with why?

Yes, it takes gut, self confidence, self respect in order to determined to walk carrying their values sometimes it is easier to follow it when we’re not bound to somewhere, or something.

Just the idea of finding our own value is still challenging for some of us, then so strong about following and applying in day to day life requires consistency.

Values are definitely like compass, you know where you’re going but don’t know the destination. It gives us good direction especially when we’re confused about literally everything. 

Strong, attached value seems like great foundation for morality. Have you asked yourself what are your values in order to gauge your being? 

I believe that only after extensive research of our own self, we realize certain ‘fixed’ beliefs which no matter what we don’t compromise. However, I don’t think it should be strict so interferes our relationship with daily activities.  

Values that I respect and try to apply on myself are

- open and honest
- truthful
- kind
- novel
- adventurous
- growth minded
- affectionate

Those are the characteristics of my compass.  How about yours?
