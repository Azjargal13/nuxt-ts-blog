So satisfying this feeling, have done something interesting and self sufficient for today's productivity. Honestly speaking today was somewhat different than my usual working routine, maybe that caused me high energy which brought satisfaction as well.

Woke up at usual time and the morning is started as regular. However in the afternoon, surrounded by full of energetic crowd in nearby cafe shop where the energy boosted at some level. Indeed, new environment keep us alert and somewhat challenge us to get comfortable as fast as possible. 

Surprisingly the mind adapted pretty easily in the atmosphere where jazz music played from the speaker in normal volume, slight chattering around and express road trafficking view of window. I might say, got comfortable so quickly that the mind or focus has been increased and able to complete some tasks well.

Was it about the surroundings (more about the material items, windows & view, music & light) or about people? At the end, we say that we are "social animal". I do not know the answer yet, but one thing I enjoyed a lot was simply could strike through some todo tasks easily which made me feel like have fulfilled something and overcame own procrastination and laziness. 

It is exciting to try something new that leads unique experience and perspective. When it related to work task, what does count as "efficient", "completed" or "well done"? Number of tasks have cleared from the long generated todo list or few high priority task are solved correctly?

Yes, me too. Am still learning/exploring such kind of progress measurement and trying to find out personal excellence level. Well, more experiments remaining ahead!
