These days I am working on finding ways to relax and remind myself of doing less things with good quality. Agree that we are so much caught up the idea of ‘doing’ many things in short amount of time and feel ‘tiredness’ and fatigue in our body to satisfy the hunger of over productivity. 

Crossing out multiple TO DO tasks from the list and keep aspiring to ‘beat’ that number to break the personal record of total number of tasks that completed on given day. I’ve used to that too, couple of years continuously which in the end led to fatigue and self disappointment. It is so hard to accept own imperfection and unproductiveness, also it is very unhealthy not being satisfied by my own actions, and start self criticizing. I am quite brilliant at the latter, at some point I was very unsatisfied by what ever I was doing and every little thing I did always turned out to be ‘not enough’. To be honest, I used to give ‘score’ every night before sleep to judge the productivity of the day. Out of 10, I’d always give around 7, 8 and realized that never ever have given 9 or 10. Clearly it shows how I am unsatisfied with myself and how pushing hard to reach the next record. Very much negativity toward inner and outer circle, and the energy can passed to people nearby, which later led to arguments between loved ones and friends. 

There is very very ‘thin’ line between healthier way to pushing oneself to reach the next milestone with sane mind and relentlessly seeking perfection from the very self. After big dip of my life, I’ve realized luckily and started understanding the former. In order to fulfill something, it starts from the love of inner self and expand it little by little.  

To start love the inner, one of the great way is to start from the thing which you genuinely like and have interest in. Mine is ‘library’, it gives me this strong feeling of ‘relaxation’ and ‘calmness’. I feel like I don’t need to rush to anywhere to do anything, instead just enjoy the smell of books and quietness, and give more attention to the inner voice and my own breath. Luckily I live in amazing city which has numerous libraries that I could literally go every single day for more than a year. Literally the paradise of library. 

Yes I am practicing the notion that we’re HUMAN-BEING not HUMAN-DOING in those cute little libraries in Tokyo 💛.
