We all hear, read and sometimes discuss about "Climate change" and its consequences. Yet still not fully understand why this is important to share and help others to get familiar with it. Maybe because most of us, have not yet feel the "climate change" or some sudden ups and downs of the natural events.

Yes, because we live in place where we afford good shelters, nutritious supplementary food, engagement activities and busy work which made us to think some type of "metropolis, urban" citizens.

However the worst effect of such environment change occurs the poor, remote area where most of us have not even touched our toes. Yet we think this is not "that serious", or have feeling that if it does not happen place I belong, till then we're good to go, such kind of mindset are keeping us backward to take any action.

Why we don't or could not do any activities in order to help or raise awareness in the respected society? Is it because we don't believe it or we don't care yet? Agree that such activities result will be shown a bit of glimpse in a longer period of time, but if there is no action at all, this will be worsen day by day.

Why? because whole society, it could be from a small family to big city, do not understand what is "Climate change". To help fellow citizen to get this issue, as a part of social citizen/individual we can start helping to educate or share such type of news (environment, climate related news) with our neighbors, family members, friends, community members or simply to whoever in our surroundings.

Then possibly a bit by bit, people would be at least get familiar with the current issue the whole world is facing. When the whole society become aware of or understand its bad effect, then could some initiatives can be taken ahead.

From individual perspective, I'd like to consider my consumer behavior first. More eco-friendly and sustainable items are my next go-to. In this type of activity any small change will be counted. Let's be a citizen who loves the Earth truly <3.
