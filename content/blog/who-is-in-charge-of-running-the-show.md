These days I am listening audio books on Audible, found this great book **Whole Brain Living** by Dr Jill Bolte Taylor, Ph.D. And Iâ€™d like to write about personal journey after reading it. Actually Iâ€™ve found out her books after listening the TED talk in [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyyjU8fzEYU), she shares insights of her stroke experience, even shows the â€˜brainâ€™ on stage ðŸ‘€ that I found pretty interesting.

Author (Dr Jill Taylor) is a neuroscientist and done various researches on brain and according to her research, the brain is divided into 4 different â€˜**characters**â€™, each has distinctive nature. Very interesting thing is if we identify our characters based on them, maybe life gets easier especially when we communicate with others and with ourselves.

We already know that left and right side of the brain operates differently, some cognitive functions processes way different such as left side dominant in logic, linear thinking, prefer facts and orders. Right side is more creative, highly imaginative and visual.

On top of this category, **Thinking & Feeling** (Emotional) sides are added on each parts, which making 4 distinct characters that makes our mind.

**The 4 characters**

**Character 1 - Left Thinking part**

- very organized
- productive
- order oriented
- direct
- logical, rational
- perfectionist
- proper rule based
- verbal, thinks in language
- judgmental
- punctual
- busy
- focus on ME
- past/future based thinking

  It triggers stress response.

  This part of my brain literally make me yell at my younger brother to lock the damn door and wash the dishes. ðŸ˜…

**Character 2 - Left Feeling part**

- rigid
- cautious
- fear based
- independent
- critical
- right/wrong and good/bad
- selfish
- righteous
- loves conditionally

**Character 3 - Right Feeling part**

- Adventurous
- Connection
- Explore new world
- expansive
- open
- kind
- grateful
- friendly
- loves unconditionally

**Character 4 - Right Thinking part**

- thinks in pictures
- present moment based
- thinks experientially
- seeks similarities
- compassionate
- collective
- flexible/resilient
- focus on WE
- available

**90-seconds rule**

Another interesting thing is, it takes less than 90 seconds to establish any emotions and pass through our body and mind. Which means everyday we jump from character to character and sometimes feel even the mixture of them, or just stay in `emotional loop` and feel grumpy whole day. It is just a Choice after all ðŸ˜….

I believe this could be applied to defeat the laziness, unproductive too. After learning this, Iâ€™ve started reminding myself of this.

**The** **BRAIN Huddle**

Not Slack Huddle of course ðŸ˜„! It is a technique, developed by Dr Jill Taylor, in order to take some off and be aware of the our choices by applying the 90-seconds rule. (please check the image above to see what it means)

**Final note**

The author suggests us to realize the each part of the character when it is needed and if possible, name them so when they arise we can recognize them and invite for BRAIN huddle. Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™ve named after seeing each of them.

Character 1, Iâ€™ve named it Nomu (originated from Nomch means, wise in Mongolian),

Character 2, Una (part of the name originated from my favorite album by Ludovico Einaudi)

Character 3, CJ (acronym of my favorite two words ðŸ˜‚ especially when the adventure mode is on)

Character 4, Ananda (Sanskrit word, meaning joy or bliss, also my name in Mongolian ðŸ’› ) because thatâ€™s what I want for my default state, the character Iâ€™d love to see in general.

How about you? Would you like to give a name for each of your characters?

It is quite interesting to see that 4 characters study overlapped in this research also in Dr Helen Fisherâ€™s **Why We Love** book, about the nature and chemistry of them.
