Personally I like strong motivation to start things in full energy, it could be new routine, project, hobby can be anything seriously…

I know all of us have this time where we are super motivated and conquer whole world in a single day, full of adrenaline rushing through body and huge excitement kicks in. In the brain, ocean of possible best cases scenario and imagining we’re standing at the summit of the things we’re doing. Day 1 went brilliant! ❤️‍🔥 Day 2 went great! Day 3 went nice! and then slowly we’re started drown the usual our routine and without you noticing it that **‘goal’** you’ve set in the beginning of the month is just forgotten completely, out of your life.

In the end, you blame yourself not being **motivated enough** to do whatever you’re planning and the endless self-critical thought clouds are in the mind, literally eating you alive and keep sucking your energy to do even daily stuff, and till “the day” come you’re just clueless and had strong self hatred and wishing how you can strike out at least one thing on the given day.

Just want to shout out loud 📢 📢 **You Are Not Alone** ( in Micheal Jackson’s singing voice)

If I am being honest with you, me and my friends discuss about this quite often and try to help each other to keep motivation or energy consistently.

You know what, have you ever lie down in bed continuously for 3 days till your magical, energetic motivation becomes from nowhere and start letting you clean yourself and ready for the work. I don’t think so, i had this experience for running trial purpose. **Motivation never comes out from nowhere.**

What does come in instead is your **systematic habit** and **discipline**, maybe little bit of **‘will’** to do something and I really experienced it. Now I get that why the book `Atomic Habit` by James Clear is huge success, because it helps us to realize that in order to beat laziness, unmotivated work and sluggish lifestyle are could be the reason of the partial habit system nothing more than that.

In the end, our brain has this strong mechanism to follow most travelled path (habit activities) without even letting us think, we usually automatically do that such as brushing teeth twice every day. So personally I want to create good habit system when starting something new and include that do my daily routine and try to do it more of like habitually instead of waiting my glorious motivation which rarely comes at odd times 😆

I want to also explain bit more in detailed why I’ve chosen the words systematic habit, discipline and will comes. There is a word saying **“You become what we do”** I agree.
Just try to genuinely look at your habit from the morning till you sleep without any criticize, simply noticing and realizing what you do is enough and you’ll get who you’ve became. I believe this is sort of self explanatory of **systematic habit**.

About **discipline** , in order to keep the habits alive and engaged in daily activity you need certain quality to stick with the plan that’s where discipline comes it. I don’t like to associate this word with Stoicism or anything, it is just realization in order to keep something going on you just need to be persistent and little bit push yourself to do that thing you’ve been slacking off and unable to catch it. Lack of it, definitely creates chaos unless you enjoy living in chaotic life 🎇

**Willpower** is quite related with discipline however I’d like to propose a little bit of difference which is `energy+effort` that is not defined by the outside characteristic, I’d say more internal body related energy. Some days we really have no energy to do anything, and that is totally acceptable since we’re made of energy balls so it does run out and need time to recharge that’s highly recommended(even weekly basis).

Yes so in the end, what I want to convey is that waiting for motivation is synonym to **killing one’s time.** I know it sounds bit direct but please think it for a moment deliberately 💭.

And in order to avoid it, safe and old method which works like charm is include that **B**IG, **A**UDACIOUS **D**REAM into your daily activity little by little (you know we can divide that lofty goal into little doable tasks) until you reach to it. And it may take time, don’t worry! Nothing is overnight success and time is also **personal**.
