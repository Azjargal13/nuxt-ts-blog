A while ago, I have an opportunity to attend MBA online trial class on Design Thinking course at GLOBIS University. Even it's only a trial class I've noticed quite a pattern among attendees, so'd like to summarize my personal experience and thought about what really mid-career MBA students expect.

About MBA, I am still thinking and considering because that's not really matter for my full time work experience, it is more of personal desire to grow more in a field of business, management side. Of course, it'd be a nice plus point!

So my criteria was more of part-time & online program which I can study on my own while working in a full-time job. Preferably it's nice if it's located in Tokyo, Japan so, on some weekends I could go to campus and feel student-life again.

By now, you've already guessed the reason why I've selected GLOBIS because it offers full & part-time online and/or campus, located in Japan and one of the top MBA schools.

The trial class was from "Design Thinking" course, and started with introduction of what design thinking means and how we generally experience this on a daily basis. Since it's design thinking course, we explore more creative ways to take care of the end-user experience and business growth. During this discussion, we're asked different kind of questions and collaborate in a group of 4-5 people to come up with great ideas, such as to design a vase the most creative way possible and think about ways to enjoy flowers at home or office. And in another group discussion we're asked what really mid-career MBA students want and the answer should be only the keywords (noun). (This post title derived from this discussion). Overall my experience in attending online class was very fun and had more of group discussion.

Alright, now let's jump to what've discussed during this topic. As I said each group has 15 mins to ask each individual's opinion and form a single answer. From that group-talk I've noticed some patterns on each group's answer and decided to summarize here.

It seems what mid-career MBA students want who attending at GLOBIS University are

- personal growth, sense of improving and learning something new
- impact on society, provide some value around their surroundings
- career shift

Let's wrap each of the "want" one by one.

## Personal growth

Yes, it seems like human beings have tendency not to like stagnant position where we too much used to the environments, work, places etc. So to change that we challenge and strength our skill-set, therefore always willing to learn something new. 

## Impact on society

When people reach at some level, have a big will to make an impact around their surroundings not only whole worldwide level but in community level too. This sense of having "bigger dream" than themselves offer paths where their personal values are attained.

## Career shift

Another reason was that most of us have realized potential career shift in our middle of career and try to decide to change the field and welcome more challenges.

There is no wonder why we don't like the same repetitive routine and deep in our heart want to feel challenged, grow and positive influence on others. 

Alright, if you've read till here I bet you also want to do either of these :)
Go ahead and let's learn more and after acquiring some knowledge let's share it to others too.
