I am writing short post about what I felt after watching the latest (as of now, by April/2021) pandemic time documentary. The content duration is about +48mins, produced in the UK. (narrated by the award winning narrator :P)

This documentary left me some sort of feeling, more of appreciating nature and other lives including domestic and wild life. Yes, whole world still fighting for covid virus and "pandemic" is not yet been taken away.

We were not yet adapted the **covid life** during mid of 2020, a bit by bit cities, provinces, states, and countries were able to manage their **after covid** life and still we are in a progress of improving the lifestyle.

Beginning of the **pandemic** made many of us feeling "lonely" and "isolated", yet the other living beings general lifestyles are started "flourishing".

Humpback whales, dolphins, sea turtles, penguins, deers, cheetahs, rhinos, elephants, and more wild-life animals life are awesomely improving during this pandemic time. Their day-to-day life become more hassle-free and engaging.

Due to lockdown of the countries how these a part of nature's belonging able to have more offsprings and expand their family surprisingly at the faster rate, compare to older years.

And another great news are air pollution, CO2 emissions are reduced at the high rate (some numbers/facts are pretty impressive). Which leads the cleaner lake/sea water flows.

I remember that in the Assam, India whole this time, residents never know they could see the world's highest mountain range Himalayas from their home roofs. Isn't this amazing? Finally people can see this great nature everyday!

I really appreciate and happy that how nature is able to balance itself soo quickly and filter out unnecessities easily.

It is the truth that human and other living beings are part of the Mother Earth, therefore in order to keep nature in their own way, we should co-exist and support both sides.

Of course, we human can love the animals and provide comfortable environment where they can live peacefully, like we do!

Thanks for educating us by making such great documentary and make us realize how sometimes we become violent is some way!

Let's be more aware of the environment and other living beings. I want to support this a lot :)
