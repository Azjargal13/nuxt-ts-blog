I am always been a fan of Yuval Noah Harari, the historian and author of "Sapiens" book (as you'd might known already) and Daniel Kanheman, the Nobel laureate on Economic Science in 2002, also the author of "Thinking fast, and slow" book (surely you might have heard about it too).

These two thinkers or I might say philosophers (in my way at least), always deliver amazing, quality of work which we all find educating and valuable source of good knowledge.

Recently, probably couple of days I was curious about finding recent talks, or interviews of Daniel Kahneman, luckily encountered their latest video interview on youtube. (published around the beginning of April, 2021). The title was more of discussion of the global trends of after covid life/pandemic over the world and some insights from the book named "Noise", latest publish of Daniel Kahnemen's work.

The video interview was about 1 hour and half, still I found them super interesting, kept me engaged whole time as I listened every sentence from both of them so carefully/attentively.

Why some countries behave in a certain way, what would be our future look like as the planet, and what is ideal way of controlling the world and human minds noise (too much feeling involved), future trends, AI, robotics and these thinkers interest for the future and many more topics are discussed openly and balanced way (not much pushing one's belief toward to others). 

Great way of opening one's ears in order to have solid way of our current society. Personally I recommend this to anybody who has certain interest on topics as mentioned in the post.

It is available to watch free of cost (on youtube!), so why don't you give a peek.
