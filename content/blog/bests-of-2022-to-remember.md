Hi there 👋🏻
2022 is about the end and another adventurous new year going to start! I was thinking about collecting things I’ve enjoyed in this year and combining them into single post so I can read it in the future to remember. Basically a journal🦥

Wish the sections include more interesting topics like best online/offline games, movies, parties, spontaneous activities etc., who knows maybe in 2023 all of them are challenged?

This time quite common topics are included such as books, audio books, cities I love the most, people I glad to meet or admire, podcasts, songs, activities, hobbies and so on. Added a bit of hook description to nudge myself for the reference. Of course, those are solely based on what I love and pretty much personal. But I encourage you to create your very own journal if you’ve interested in this idea. Personally I like to go back and read my stuffs, reflect what my thoughts at that phase of time.

## Best 3 books

- Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle
- Supernormal: The untold story of Adversity by Dr Meg Jay
- Ego is the Enemy by Ryan Holiday

In that particular order, yes!

All of the 3 books made me quite emotional, especially Dr Jay’s book left me sobbing for couple of hours. At some point I was determined to translate the book to Mongolian, wish someone do it so many people can learn from it.

After reading Eckhart’s book, I had this weird bitter sweet feeling about guilt that why have not choose to read it earlier, at the same time super glad that read it when I really needed. Anyways every great book leave this guilt of “Why haven’t I found it earlier?” 

Ryan’s book somehow now makes sense especially after Eckhart’s book and learning about philosophy in general.

## Best 3 audio books

- [Whole Brain Living by Jill Bolte Taylor Phd](https://www.amazon.com/Whole-Brain-Living-Anatomy-Characters-ebook/dp/B08W29Q2CR)
I’ve got to know about the author from TED talk actually, really enjoyed her talk so I was searching about her and found this amazing book. I’ve listened the audio book which recorded by her, the emotions are very transparent to the ears.
- [Indistractable by Nir Eyal](https://www.amazon.com/Indistractable-Control-Your-Attention-Choose-ebook/dp/B07PG2W6DC/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=indistractable&qid=1672135516&s=digital-text&sprefix=indestra%2Cdigital-text%2C369&sr=1-1)
Third favorite Israeli author. I feel like he must be besties of James Clear and Cal Newport. Learned about Time Blocking, turning off notifications, use “Focus”, “Do Not Disturb” mode and many more.
- [The Gap and the Gain by Dan Sullivan, Dr. Benjamin Hardy](https://www.amazon.com/Gap-Gain-Achievers-Happiness-Confidence-ebook/dp/B08TGTK2L2/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+gap+and+the+gain+dan+sullivan&qid=1672135546&s=digital-text&sprefix=the+gap%2Cdigital-text%2C367&sr=1-1)
Might know Dr Hardy from his TED talk or YT channel, it is very practical book. This duo has done great collaboration for this book, the audio book sounds like Dr Hardy is interviewing coach Dan Sullivan who is expert at entrepreneurship and strategy.

## Best 3 cities

- Antalya, Turkey

    Something different about this place compared to other crowded cities in Turkiye. At some point in my life, I could live here for some time. Even though I’ve stayed for a short time, left me feeling of wandering, also amazing desserts to crave.
- Matsumoto, Nagano

    This place actually made me awake half of the night questioning myself and for the first time I was quite terrified about my plan. Also it literally made me practice the “mindfulness meditation” which I was doing for years only in my peaceful room but in the real complicated, chaotic life 😂. It was interesting to feel my own anger, disappointment and joy at the same time.
- Beppu, Oita

    My bestie's sweet home. Beautiful place, loved visiting the uni campus located at the top of mountain and undoubtedly relaxing variety of onsens (hot spring bathes). Great to escape for quiet holiday.

## Best 3 activities

- Have therapist and consult regularly
  
    Glad I’ve made this decision, somehow postponing it for a year or so, but at the right time I’ve had good therapist who can help me when I needed the most.
- Watching basketball game at the stadium
    
    Never thought myself enjoy watching basketball. I have seriously no clue about rules or whatsoever, fortunately we had someone who can explain it clearly, turned out to be super entertaining. Left the stadium, had few crushes 😂
- Watching the ballet “Giselle”

## Best 3 podcasts

- [HBR IdeaCast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hbr-ideacast/id152022135)
- [After Hours](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/after-hours/id1363110130)
- [Daily Stoic](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-daily-stoic/id1430315931) 

    This is best when doing exercise or jogging 🏃🏻

## Best 3 songs

- Nothing is Lost - The Weeknd
- You’ll be fine - spring gang
- Know about us - Sionya

## Best people I’m glad to know

I love and admire my loved ones but these special people whom I got to know in this year. 

- Eckhart Tolle (teacher who practices mindfulness and meditation)
- A Friend from London
- American couple (Ohh! I really loved to meet you guys, unfortunately we forgot to exchange our IGs, what a shame! but it’s okay because we enjoyed our talk and I fully remember all your advices ❣️)

## Best 3 hobbies

- Visiting flower gardens or parks
- Writing
- Meditation

## Best 3 phrases

- Yes, baby! I’ve chosen MYSELF
- Peace Please!
- Enjoy the moment 💗

## Best question from myself

- What am I doing, really?

Yes, that’s all! Super grateful for all the memories. Thanks for this challenging yet another unforgettable year❣️.
